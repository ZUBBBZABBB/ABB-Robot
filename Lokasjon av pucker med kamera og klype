1 Introduction
For 5.3 see 2.1 communications.py. For 5.4 see 2.2 image acquisition.py, here
we have defined all functions we need for the camera and finding QR codes.
In 2.3 helper funcs.py we have defined helper functions needed for pixels to
mm, calculating robtarget, and picking up pucks.
In cam adjust lab.py 2.4 we have the program that tries to calculate the
slope offset off the camera.
The ”main” program lives in 2.5 main.py, this program uses multithreading
to show the camera feed live, while picking up pucks. We currently have two
modes, the first you select which puck to pick up and where to place it, and the
second it will pick up one puck and place it randomly, then go to the overview
position and find the puck and do it again.
We wanted to try a program that uses multiple pucks, but due to not getting
good enough QR-code detection we didn’t manage anything here. (When there
was multiple pucks it usually only found one, or it found both but not on the
same frame, so it flickered between them.)
For the robot modules, we used cam adjust.mod 2.6 for the cam adjust part.
This one moves the robot to simple robtarget.
For the main program we used pythoncom.mod 2.7.
